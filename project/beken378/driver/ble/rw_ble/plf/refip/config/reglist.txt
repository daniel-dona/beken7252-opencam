# @brief This file contains the register files for build process. 

# This file contains the description of the register files that must be parsed during
# the build process.  The first element is the name of the register description file, it
# is expected to be an XLS (EXCEL) sheet meeting the standard RivieraWaves format.
# The second element is the base address of the register block described in the input
# file.
# The third element informs if the output register file must use long naming format or
# short one.  Long naming means that the register's name are appended to each field name,
# short naming means that the field names are used directly.  If two registers are using
# the same field name, long naming should be used.  This is not verified during register
# build time but at compilation time.
